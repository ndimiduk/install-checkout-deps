# install-checkout-deps

A leiningen plugin to facilitate tracking SNAPSHOT dependencies in checkouts.

With this plugin installed, before leinignen runs the deps task it
will run "lein install" in each checkout repository. This will ensure
the very latest SNAPSHOT version of each checkout is available
locally, which will ensure transitive dependencies are picked up.

## Usage

Add [install-checkout-deps "1.0.0"] to :dev-dependencies in project.clj
